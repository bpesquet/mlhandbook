```{glossary}

Accuracy
  Evaluation metrix measuring the fraction of predictions that a classification model got right ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_of_binary_classifiers)).

Activation function
  A function (for example, ReLU or sigmoid) that generates a (typically nonlinear) output. Used in neural networks to define the output of a layer ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function)).

AUROC
  Area Under the ROC Curve. An aggregate measure of a classifier' performance across all possible classification thresholds ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve)).

Automatic differentiation (autodiff)
  Soon!

Backpropagation
  Mathematical technique used to obtain the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights of a neural network. Applies the chain rule to compute the gradients one layer at a time, iterating backward from the last layer ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation)).

Batch
  A set of examples used in one iteration (that is, one gradient update) during model training. Batch size defines the number of examples in a batch ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent)).

Bias
  Soon!

Boosting
  Soon!

Broadcasting
  Soon!

Confusion matrix
  Soon!

Decision boundary
  Frontier between the classes learned by a classification model.

Precision
  Evaluation matrix measuring the frequency with which a model was correct when predicting the positive class ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_of_binary_classifiers)).

Self-supervised learning
  Form of Machine Learning in which labels are automatically generated from the data itself, then a model is supervisely trained on the resulting dataset.
