# Machine Learning Handbook

This repository contains the source files for the [Machine Learning Handbook](https://www.bpesquet.fr/mlhandbook), my textbook for teaching Machine Learning. More info [here](index.md).

## Development notes

### Generating HTML output

The [Machine Learning Handbook](https://www.bpesquet.fr/mlhandbook) website is generated by [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org). After installing it, execute the following command in the root folder to generate the HTML output:

```bash
jupyter-book build .
```

### Adding or updating katas

The practical challenges, named _katas_, are generated with [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/) with missing answers. Teacher versions (corrections) live in a separate private repository.

### Exporting a notebook to a PDF file

Use [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io) in the same directory as the source file:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to PDF <chapter_file_name>.ipynb
```

> For now, GIF files must be replaced by their PNG counterparts before launching the conversion process.
