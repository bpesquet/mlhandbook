# Machine Learning Handbook

This book provides theorical explanations, Python-based demonstrations and practical challenges for various Machine Learning concepts, techniques and tools.

It is the main textbook for courses I teach at French engineering schools [ENSC](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr). [ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr) and [IOGS](https://www.institutoptique.fr). Its content is inspired by a large number of sources, from which numerous ideas and some illustrations were borrowed ([more details](./appendix/acknowledgments.md)).

Demonstrations and challenges leverage the essential tools of the Python ecosystem for Machine Learning: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
