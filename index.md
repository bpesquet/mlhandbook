# Machine Learning Handbook

This site provides theorical explanations and Python-based demonstrations for various Machine Learning concepts, techniques and tools. Associated practical challenges (_katas_) can be found [here](https://www.bpesquet.fr/mlkatas).

## About

This is my main textbook for teaching Machine Learning at French engineering schools [ENSC](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr). [ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr) and [IOGS](https://www.institutoptique.fr).

Its content is inspired by a large number of sources, from which numerous ideas and several illustrations were borrowed (more details [here](./reference/acknowledgments.md)).

Demonstrations and challenges leverage the essential tools of the Python ecosystem for Machine Learning: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

## Usage

All chapters are written as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) combining explanations and example code. When teaching, I use [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to showcase them as live presentations.

The content of this site is designed to be browsed thematically rather than sequentially.

:class: tip
From any chapter, you can launch a live session in the cloud by pressing the <i class="fas fa-rocket" title="rocket"></i> button in the toolbar above and selecting a hosted runtime environment. You will be able to test the code and regenerate the chapter output.
